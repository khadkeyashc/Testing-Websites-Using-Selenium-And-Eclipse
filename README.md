# Testing-Websites-Using-Selenium-And-Eclipse
 Project Overview
This project is a comprehensive collection of test automation examples using:
Selenium IDE: A Chrome extension for record-and-playback of web UI tests.
Eclipse + Selenium WebDriver (Java): For writing custom automated test scripts.
It covers:
Test Suite Creation: Using Selenium IDE for basic test recording (e.g., testing the Rohit Sharma Wikipedia page).
Automated Website Testing: With custom Java code in Eclipse + Selenium WebDriver for various websites (e.g., Selenium official site, Javatpoint, InfoPlanet, etc.).
DOM Interaction Techniques: Tests using element selectors like By.name, By.id, etc.
Functional UI Testing: Test cases for HTML-based calculator apps (Addition, Subtraction, Multiplication, Division, Even-Odd checking, etc.).
HTML + JS Demos: Simple HTML forms/scripts are tested for basic mathematical operations.
This serves as an educational toolkit for understanding how to perform manual and automated website testing.

# Software and Website Testing using Eclipse and Selenium

## 📌 What is this project?
This is a hands-on collection of practical examples and test cases designed to teach the fundamentals of **software and website testing** using:
- **Selenium IDE** (a Chrome extension for test recording)
- **Java with Eclipse IDE** using **Selenium WebDriver**

It includes step-by-step test case implementations for real websites and custom HTML pages, demonstrating how to automate and validate UI functionality.

## 🚀 What does it offer?

- ✅ A complete guide to recording test suites using Selenium IDE.
- ✅ Java-based automated test cases using Selenium WebDriver in Eclipse.
- ✅ Example websites used: Wikipedia, Javatpoint, InfoPlanet, Guru99, etc.
- ✅ Custom HTML programs for:
  - Addition, Subtraction, Multiplication, Division (of 2 and 3 numbers)
  - Even-Odd number checking
- ✅ Demonstrations of locating elements using `name`, `id`, and interacting with DOM.

## 🎯 What will you learn?

By exploring this project, you will gain:
- 🔹 Practical experience in writing and executing test automation scripts.
- 🔹 Understanding of element locators and browser automation in Java.
- 🔹 Skills to test web applications and HTML/JS forms.
- 🔹 Experience setting up Selenium IDE and Eclipse for testing workflows.
- 🔹 Confidence in performing both **manual** and **automated** functional testing.

## 🛠 Technologies Used

- Java
- Eclipse IDE
- Selenium WebDriver
- Selenium IDE (Chrome extension)
- HTML + JavaScript (for testing mini-programs)

## 📂 Structure Overview

- `/selenium-ide-tests/`: Recorded test suites with Selenium IDE
- `/eclipse-selenium-scripts/`: Java test automation scripts for real websites
- `/html-programs/`: Custom web pages for calculator-style apps
- `/test-cases/`: Automated scripts for functional validation of those pages

## 👨‍💻 How to Run

1. Install [Selenium IDE](https://www.selenium.dev/selenium-ide/)
2. Set up [Eclipse IDE](https://www.eclipse.org/) and add Selenium WebDriver libraries
3. Clone this repo
4. Run Java test classes from Eclipse
5. Open HTML pages in a browser to test manually or via Selenium

## 📚 Ideal For

- Beginners in **test automation**
- Students learning **Selenium with Java**
- Developers exploring **UI functional testing**
- QA trainees preparing for real-world testing environments
